    <h1>The Chosen Ones are Tired of Saving the World</h1>

        <p class="shortStories-text">
            Roy and I were chosen to protect the world over three decades ago. Man, how time flies when you have to face beasts on a daily basis. Except it doesn't. We didn't sign up for this shit. It was supposed to be a one-time thing, y'know? Take the villain out and live happily ever after. But it feels like we are still on the "Once upon a time" stage. It's a vicious cycle since, guess what, the world is never not in danger.

We enjoyed the attention at first. We went from nobodies to having statues of ourselves scattered throughout the town. People would cheer as they saw us with our swords drenched in blood, severed monsters' heads on our hands. They would throw parties to celebrate their safety and sing about our many feats. However, we were never that into partying. Roy and I would usually sneak away and head to the ice-cream parlor next to my place. He loved the mint chocolate ice cream, for reasons beyond my comprehension. I shudder in disgust from the mere thought. If it was cold, we would hit the pancake factory instead. The prices were staggeringly high, yet that didn't pose a problem. We learned two valuable things during our time as Chosen Ones: 1. People will treat you like you are special because you are; 2. You will never have to pay for another meal in your entire life. That was the reward for getting rid of wackos that wished to turn the entire human population into pigeons... And that was a regular Tuesday.

I was sick and tired of regular Tuesdays, and every other day of the week. Bored of saving the world, again and again, hearing the same people cheer in the same obnoxious way, and eating ice cream or pancakes as if we hadn't gone numb to the taste.

"Another Overlord is on the rise," Roy told me last month. His weary eyes were glued to the screen of his laptop. "He seeks destruction. What do you think his backstory is?"

I took a sip of my herbal tea without turning a hair. "Horrible childhood with a pinch of dead parents and toxic friendships."

"Or he grew up thinking he was going to be the Chosen One."

"Want to text him so that we can meet up and switch roles?"

Roy chuckled but, then, he turned serious. It happened in the snap of a finger. His broad toothy smile vanished from sight as he got lost in thoughts, which didn't happen often.

"You okay, pal?" I asked with genuine concern. I could almost see the rusty cogs inside his brain turning.

"Why don't we take a break?" His proposal was a bolt from the blue. "I'm sure someone else can take care of this guy."

"You can't retire from being a hero, Roy."

"Who said anything about retirement? I'm talking about going on vacation for a while." He sat next to me, forcing the teacup away from my grip so that I would focus on him, and only him. That wasn't too hard. It was my favorite hobby. "Aren't you exhausted of the bloodshed? The cheers?"

"Our celebratory meals?" I added and he nodded in response.

I had no idea Roy felt the same way I did until that accursed day. We made a terrible decision when we allowed ourselves to enjoy life for once. Nobody took care of the Overlord as they were expecting us to do it. He succeeded in destroying everything and everyone, for the sake of it.

My life was great, yet I led myself to believe it was boring. Now I want it back. That's not possible, I'm afraid. There are not enough people left to cheer. There are no more ice-cream parlors and no pancake factories. No best friend to love.

"Roy," I whisper as my hand caresses his cold body. "Wake up." Tears slither down my cheeks and land on his disheveled hair. "Let's save the world."
