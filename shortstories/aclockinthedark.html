    <h1>A Clock in the Dark</h1>

        <p class="shortStories-text">
            It’s midnight. The room that was once full of light is now dark, pitch-black. The furniture that overflows the place has vanished from sight like it never existed. In this somber and silent atmosphere, darkness gives birth to one lonesome sound that keeps me awake, that sends shivers down my spine. What is it? Raindrops plummeting on the ground. A hammer hitting a nail again and again. Heavy steps coming this way. No. It’s just the clock on the wall. <br>

The clock is ticking as if it had something to say. Tick-Tock. “It’s late.” <br>

I don’t care if it’s late. I’m not comfortable enough to wander off to dreamland. The bed—or the couch, to be more precise—is hard to the touch. It’s neither soft nor fluffy, but rough and bumpy. Grainy, as if someone had put sand under these slim sheets. The sheets are useless. They don’t provide that much-needed warmth. And my body is trembling, though it’s not only because of the cold. I’m scared. Fear has its grip on me and it tightens by the second. <br>
Horrible thoughts plague my mind and won’t leave me alone. I’m having nightmares in my waking moments. I remind myself this is all worth it. Tomorrow morning, I get to hang out with grandma and grandpa again. We might go out to eat, there’s a restaurant next door that they love with all their heart. Or maybe we’ll stay inside and play games all day. Whatever it is that we choose, I know we’ll laugh like we always do. <br>

The clock is ticking as if it had something to say. Tick-Tock. “Time to sleep.” <br>

I’m not tired. Besides, how could anyone fall asleep with the odor that permeates this minute room? It smells weird. Not good, and not bad, just weird. The way old people smell like. Too many candies and too many pills. The most beautiful flowers and inexorable death. What does death smell like? Intoxicating, as a sweet perfume. You take his decaying hand and it leads you astray. He’s here. I can feel his presence in my bones. But he’s not here for me. Death shushes me, it urges me to remain quiet. I don’t want to obey his command, yet the words are stuck in the lump of my throat. I can’t get them out. I can’t scream to warn those that I hold dear. <br>
The clock is ticking as if it had something to say. Tick-Tock. “Good night.” 

My eyes refuse to close. My mind refuses to turn off. The air has turned bitter out of the blue. Everything around me is dark, and cold, and hard to the touch. It’s so bitter, though the smell is oddly comforting. Intoxicating. Stop. It’s loud, very loud. My ears are ringing, but nobody hears a thing. I do. They are not raindrops plummeting on the ground. It’s not a hammer hitting a nail again and again. They are not heavy steps coming this way. No. It’s just the clock on the wall. The clock is ticking, and it won’t stop ticking. It drives me insane. <br>

Death opens a door somewhere nearby. This is not his house, he doesn’t belong, so what is he here to steal? The sun will shine eventually to remove this veil of darkness. Hurry! Death will leave when that time comes. Go away! Everything else will remain exactly the same. Right? <br>

The clock is ticking as if it had something to say. Tick-Tock. “Sweet dreams.”
