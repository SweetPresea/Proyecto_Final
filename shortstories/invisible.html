            "What are we gonna do?" 

            "How am I supposed to know?" 
            
            My name is Lucas, and I'm the third wheel in this conversation. We have gathered at the dining table for reasons unbeknownst to me. Evan and Chris are in front of me, facing each other with furrowed brows. Evan is sweating like a pig, droplets of sweat rest over his upper lip, brown hair plastered to his forehead. His right leg is going up and down. Up and down. Up and down. Chin against locked hands, Chris hunches over the table until it sinks a tad. An eerie silence wraps around us. I can hear the house settling, the clock ticking in the kitchen, and horns outside the window. 
            
            "What are we talking about again?" I ask, eyes darting from one to the other, yet there is no response. 
            
            Sigh. These two losers will never grow up! My brothers love torturing me by pretending I'm invisible. They've been at it since we were kids. Usually, their prank would last either a few minutes or weeks. 
            
            "Can we not do this today?" I am so not in the mood. 
            
            "Let's say it was an accident," Evan says after what feels like an eternity. His voice is quivering, and he's spitting his words out. 
            
            "What was an accident?" 
            
            "That's stupid," Chris tells Evan, ignoring me. "Nobody would believe such a lie. It's too obvious." He acts calm and collected, yet I detect a tinge of discomfort in the twitch of his left eye. 
            
            "Well, what do you suggest?" 
            
            "Let me think!" Chris looks over his shoulder as if terrified of someone being there. Mom and dad aren't home, though. It's just the three of us, even if they won't acknowledge my presence. 
            
            "If you tell me what the problem is, maybe I could help," I interrupt. Once again, nothing. I cross my lips and pout, tired of this charade. "Fine, have it your way!" 
            
            "We should start by hiding him," Chris decides. 
            
            "Like, under the bed?" 
            
            "Oh, I was thinking inside the closet or some shit." Chris bangs his fists on the table, and the sound echoes across the room. "This is serious, you idiot! We have to put him somewhere nobody is going to find him. Then we can say that little annoyance ran away." 
            
            Evan rises from his seat, and I can almost picture a tail wiggling on his lower rear. He has finally cracked a smile. "That's genius!" 
            
            "Of course, it's genius. It was my idea." Chris was never the modest type. I roll my eyes as he leans back triumphantly. Then, his eyes pop wide open. "But where are we gonna hide him?" 
            
            Evan sits back down. He opens his mouth, yet no words come out. He doesn't want to get yelled at again. Chris can get pretty aggressive at times, after all. Once, he punched me in the stomach until I threw up because I told him that his shirt was inside out. How was I supposed to know it was a fashion statement?
            
            "Let's bury him in the garden," Chris suggests at last. Why does it seem like they are talking about a dead body? "I'll go pick him up, and you get the shovel from dad's garage." Evan nods in response. 
            
            I'm creeped out for real. "Okay, guys, you win!" I exclaim with my hands in the air. "Very funny, but can you please talk to me already?" The two of them stand up to do what they had just said. "Stop!" I shout before they can move their chairs another inch. They freeze. My voice must have sent shivers up their spineâ€”it's not like I get angry often. 
            
            "It's weird..." Evan mumbles. "It almost feels like Lucas is here right now." 
            
            "That's because I am!" 
            
            "What if he wants revenge?" he goes on. 
            
            "Don't be silly," Chris replies as he heads toward my room. "There is no such thing as ghosts."
