    <h1>Like a Moth to a Flame</h1>

        <p class="shortStories-text">
            You are beautiful and mesmerizing. Mortals fall head over heels in love with you, left and right. You have men eating from the palm of your hand like the Goddess you are. People run toward you like moths to a flame. And they try to hold on for as long as they can because they want to be a part of your sweet embrace forevermore, no matter how hard it may get. They persevere. They are crazy about you.

            On the other hand, sometimes they don’t even dare say my name. I am that which they fear with all their heart. The thought of me slips into their minds and sends shivers down their spines, all the way to the toes. What am I if not a constant reminder that they should appreciate you more? Because I am neither beautiful nor mesmerizing, but horrible and despicable. At the very least, that’s what everyone seems to think about me. They perceive us like polar opposite, and perhaps they are right. You are so wonderful, and I am nothing like you.
            
            You bring humans immeasurable joy. You are the reason why they get out of bed each morning, the reason why they laugh. They are imitating that blinding smile you have, flawless. It’s nothing like the permanent scowl I wear. You bring them joy. I hand them sorrow in pieces too big to swallow. They might choke.
            
            If change were a possibility, then, trust me, I would change everything about me and nothing about you. You, my dear, are the embodiment of perfection. We are both merely sticking to the roles we have been assigned. You won the lottery with yours, but it’s not my desire to switch jobs. I wish nothing but the best for you. If that means I have to play the villain so that you can be the valiant hero, so be it. You can be the good one, the fantasy, all which is right in this enchanting world. I will continue to be the monster under the bed, the nightmare in the waking hours, all which is wrong in this rotten world.
            
            I can’t help but wonder… What do you think about me? If we could so much as be in the same room together, would you dance with me? Would you give me the time of day? Or would you turn away, repulsed by what I represent? I love you. You don’t love me. That’s what I believe, since we have never spoken before. There’s this invisible yet powerful force around us that keeps me apart from your side. But I’m always watching, and you are always blowing my mind away. How do you do it?
            
            You are beautiful and mesmerizing. I have fallen head over heels in love with you from the moment I found out about your existence. I want to eat from the palm of your hand because you attract me like a moth to a flame. And there’s this longing within me. I long for your touch, to be a part of your sweet embrace forevermore, no matter how against us the odds may be. I would persevere. I am crazy about you.
            
            This love is forbidden. Forgive me. My feelings would make you shudder with terror. We can’t be together, even those puny mortals are aware that my fate is to have a broken heart for the rest of eternity. They shall go on adoring you. They shall go on loathing me.
            
            People call you Life.
            
            People call me Death.
