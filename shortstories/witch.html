    <h1>Self-Help Books for Aspiring Witch</h1>

        <p class="shortStories-text">
            I swing the door of the library open. With stooped shoulders, I walk inside, hoping the wide brim of my hat is casting a shadow over my solemn expression. Furrowed brows and quivering lips, it's better if nobody sees those. My head is about to split in half from the pain of holding the tears. There has to be a book in here that can help me. I refuse to sink to my knees, defeated. My heart, dreams, and hopes can't shatter just like that. 

            How to find out if you are a witch? That's a promising title! The description on the back reads: "Puberty is hard enough without the puzzle of whether you hold magical powers or not. Your doubts will wash away as I teach you a myriad of methods to learn if you are a witch or another boring mortal." I do a quick skim of the first pages. A chapter pulls me in, one that talks about an amulet that can unleash the power coursing through your veins. I feel it somewhere inside me. I am a witch, and this book will help me prove it. 
            
            (...)
            
            I push the door open with the ball of my fingers, gnawing the inside of my mouth. Jealousy grips me by the throat, yet that's not what brought me here. With my pointy hat slightly askew, I shuffle to the bookshelves. An everlasting sigh filters out of sealed lips when I see it. 
            
            So your cat is a witch, now what? My foot taps the wooden floor nervously as I study the words on the back. "Cats have always been a mystery, yet witchy cats are on a whole other level! This book covers: Learning to love unconditionally, teaching your feline pet spells, how to shield yourself from those power-fueled claws, where to buy a proper outfit for your cat, among other things." There are countless pictures inside. Cats wearing witch hats, black capes, and even holding wands between their teeth. Winnie, it looks like we have a lot of work to do. 
            
            (...)
            
            I open the door to the library as silently as humanly possible. The lights are out, but it seems there's not a soul in sight. I trudge forward and squint my eyes to make out the titles of the pile of books in front of me. It's scary in here, but it's scarier outside. Without my hat, a part of me is missing. My rumpled ginger hair is out for display, and it looks a bit too much like fire. The pounding of my heart makes it hard to listen to anything else. Am I truly alone? I gasp for air and wipe my sweaty palms over the torn dress. Now they are covered in dirt. I plummet with one book in hand.
            
            Easy ways to avoid being burnt at the stake. The author says, "Has someone accused you of heresy? Worry not! Following these methods, even an evil witch, like yourself, can get away scot-free." There are over five hundred pages. Heavy steps rumble on the other side of the room. 
            
            It isn't fair. Why is this happening to me? I didn't kill that woman, but I can't let them hurt Winnie for her slip up. If only there was a self-help book on how to apologize to your best friend who is also a witch and a cat. They are going to kill me, and my last words to her were simmering with rage. 
            
            A single tear rolls down my cheek. There's not enough time to read this or any other book. Not enough time to say goodbye. Soon, flames will wrap around my body.
