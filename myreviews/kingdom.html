            I’ve had a hard time narrowing down what I wanted to rate this book. I flew through the pages and always had questions about what was going to happen next – but the main character made me want to slam my head against a wall more often than not. Will I be reading the next book? Oh yeah.

            I am a sucker for books with witches and magic in them so reading this was a no brainer. The magic system was explained well and consistent throughout the book. I do want a spell book of my own now.
            
            Emilia, the main character, would often go off on her own to search for a murderer — even though she was vastly unprepared and had no real idea what she was facing which just made me wonder if she had a death wish or enjoyed the thrill of close calls. I rooted for her but most of her choices were dumb and the fact that she survived this book is a miracle to say the least.
            
            The main love interest, Wrath, was my favorite character of the book because most of his decisions made sense. I’m going to need more Wrath content for sure, and I have many theories about what the next book will hold.
            
            With that being said, I am off to go make some pesto pasta ASAP.
